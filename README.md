# Higher or Lower

Higher or Lower is a simple arcade-style game where the player controls a circle at the bottom of the screen. Rectangles with random numbers fall from the top, and the player must move the circle left or right to collide with the rectangles. The player earns points by colliding the circle with rectangles whose numbers are higher than those in other rectangles.

# How to Play

* Use the left and right arrow keys to move the circle horizontally.
* The game starts with a 30-second timer. Score as many points as possible by colliding with rectangles whose numbers are higher than the other falling rectangle.
* If the circle collides with a rectangle, the player earns a point if the number in that rectangle is higher than the other one.
* The game ends after 30 seconds, and a final score screen displays the player's score.
